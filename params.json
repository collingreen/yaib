{"name":"Yaib","tagline":"Yet Another Irc Bot -- Plugin based IRC bot in Python","body":"Yet Another IRC Bot --  Plugin-based IRC bot written in Python\r\n\r\nYaib is a python IRC bot that uses plugins to add any desired\r\nfunctionality. Yaib runs anywhere python can run and just needs network access\r\nto connect to the irc servers.\r\n\r\nPlease contribute to yaib by filing issues, contributing pull\r\nrequests, or creating new plugins!\r\n\r\nYou can chat about yaib in #yaib on irc.afternet.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\nYou must have python installed to run Yaib. You should also\r\nhave virtualenv (for any python project) or, if not, pip. You\r\nwill also need git to clone the repository.\r\n\r\nclone this repository (you can also just download the master zip)\r\n~~~\r\ngit clone git@github.com:collingreen/yaib\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nchange to the yaib directory\r\n~~~\r\n`cd yaib`\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n(optional) create a virtualenvironment in the venv folder, then activate it\r\n~~~\r\nvirtualenv venv\r\n. venv/bin/activate\r\n// (on windows venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ninstall the requirements\r\n~~~\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nYaib ships with an example config file, but will not function until you\r\ncreate a `config.json` file with your real configuration. In particular,\r\nyou will probably want to change the server Yaib connects to, her nick,\r\nand the default channels to which she should connect.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ncp config-example.json config.json\r\n~~~\r\n-- edit your config.json as necessary --\r\n\r\nNow that Yaib is fully configured, you can start her up!\r\n~~~\r\npython yaib.py\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf you are running Yaib on a server somewhere, you probably want to either\r\nrun her disconnected from your current shell (`python yaib.py &`), in the\r\nbackground (usually ctrl-z, then `bg`), or in a separate `screen`. This will\r\nlet Yaib keep running while you do other things (just don't turn off the\r\nserver).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYaib ships with several plugins that provide many features out of the box. You\r\ncan learn more about plugins below, but to get started immediately, simply\r\njoin a channel where Yaib is running and type `!help` (assuming you haven't\r\nchanged your `command_prefix` in the configuration file).","google":"UA-58049194-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
